This project addresses the need for a secure and efficient authentication protocol by proposing an alternative to conventional password-based authentication. The objective is to design a mechanism that eliminates the storage of user credentials on the authentication server, enhances security, and minimizes the overhead associated with existing authentication protocols.


**PROJECT SCOPE**

The project aims to design a secure and efficient authentication protocol based on biometrics, specifically using a fingerprint image.

1.Biometric-Based Authentication: Utilizing a user's fingerprint image as a secret credential for authentication.

2.Private Key Generation: Generating a private key from the fingerprint image for secure enrolment in the authentication server's database. 

3.Secure Communication: Establishing secure communication between users and servers without storing user credentials on the authentication server.

4.Session Key Generation: Proposing a fast and robust approach to generate session keys using two fingerprint data for secure message transmission.

5.Message Authentication Mechanism: Introducing a biometric-based message authenticator as an alternative to traditional message authentication protocols.

**MODULE DESIGN:**

•**Client**: Registers and logs in using username/password or fingerprint. Sends requests, gets responses, accesses cloud files, and views file permissions.

•**Authentication Server**: Logs in, views client details, authorizes access, and manages synthetic fingerprint & user images.

•**Admin**: Logs in, uploads user files, views all uploads, adds synthetic fingerprint images, and accesses repository data.

•**Resource Server**: Logs in, views client requests, and manages user file access rights.



**IMPLEMENTATION**

**Development Environment and Tools Used**:


▪Programming Language: Java

▪Web Development Framework: Java Server Faces (JSF) 

▪Database Management System: MySQL 

▪Integrated Development Environment (IDE): NetBeans 8.1 

▪Web Server:Apache Tomcat 7.0

▪Web Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 

▪Version Control: Git



**TESTING**

**MANUAL TESTING:**

•Unit Testing: Checks small parts of code to ensure they work correctly. It's crucial in Extreme Programming (XP) for ongoing testing and improvement.

•Integration Testing: Tests how different parts of a program work together to find issues early. It's vital in XP for thorough software development through continuous testing.

•System Testing: Ensures smooth integration of biometric data and cloud services, strong security, high performance, and reliable error handling.

•User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Checks user-related aspects like enrollment, authentication, errors, and interface ease. It aims to gather user feedback for system enhancement.
